This project is used to work with polytnomial equations containing two variables, given the vlqaue of one of them.
The equation needs to be inputted in the form of 'equation:x=<xVal>;y=<+/-><num>.x^<num>....'
Where each term consistes of a positive or negative sign and each <num> can be replaced by an interger of our choice (as of now, negative intergers aren't accepted, as co-efficient simply because the sign at the beginning of each term can be used to carry out the same function,
and for exponeents, because the code does not possess that functrionality yet.
Given the value of x and the terms, the value of y will computed by convert the string to json by extracting all the values and carrying out a final set of computations over the generated json structure.
